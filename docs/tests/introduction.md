The **Software Testing** is the set of operations carried out by development teams to verify that the software meets technical specifications. In the specific context of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), the testing aims to verify that the requirements have been fully and correctly implemented, covering what the IEC 62304 calls **Software Verification**.

:::warning
Please note that **Software Verification** differs from **Software Validation**. *Software Verification* aims to verify if the software meets the requirements. *Software Validation* aims to validate if the requirements meets customer specifications.  
:::

With Mia-Care P4SaMD you can use three different testing layers:
* [Unit Testing](./unit-tests.md)
* [Integration Testing](./integration-tests.md)
* [System Testing](./e2e-tests.md)

## Quality Management System adaptation

The proposed testing levels were identified by Mia-Care as necessary to meet the directives of the IEC 62304 standard, also following the Quality Management System (QMS) of Mia-Care, and therefore have a native integration with Mia-Care P4SaMD.

However, testing levels, as well as the tools and approaches used, can be modified and extended according to the needs, allowing you to adapt Mia-Care P4SaMD to the reference QMS.

For further information about testing customization, please refer to Mia-Care Support Team.
