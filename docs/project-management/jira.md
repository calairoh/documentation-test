## Version
For each project, the release are managed by the **Fix Versions** field. In the *Release* section of Jira project, the versions can be managed through: start date, release date and the description field. 
:::danger
Make sure to have created at least one Version before creating an issue for the project, so that the new-created issue can be linked to the correct version filling up the Fix Versions field. For more details about the Fix Versions, see the issue sections written below.
:::
 
:::info
**Description** field is meant to be used to report potential breaking changes. This will be reported in the [Release Note](#release-note).
:::
 

## Software Item
The Software Items composing the system software can be inserted as Components in the project side menu. 
:::info
**Description** 
This field is meant to report the software item classification: specify *Class A*, *Class B* or *Class C* to tag them.
:::

## Execution Test 
The test issues allow to keep track the verification and report the steps to be executed by the tester. 
To create an Execution test, click on the automation test next to the status button, choose the *SaMD: Execution test - Creation* automation to generate the execution of the selected test. At the end, it will be linked properly with the reference Test.  
> It is important to check if the Fix Verisons reports the correct version of the product to be tested. The Test SaMD can collects multiple Fix Versions, while the execution refeers to a specific version.

* REPORTED
* ANALYSIS
* STAND-BY
* REFUSED
* PLANNED
* IN PROGRESS
* COMPLETED

:::info
**Related Requirements**
The changes can be link to
* 2 Requirements when one is no longer valid (status: DEPRECATED, Fix Versions: a previous one with respect to the Fix Version of the change) and the other one is new (status: not depracated, e.g. DRAFT and Fix Versions: the same of the current Change) 
* 1 new Requirement when the change add a requirement to the current version (Fix Versions: the same of the current Change) or 1 deprecated Requirement if the change deletes the requirement in the current version

## Automation
### SaMD: Execution test - Creation
The automation clones a Test SaMD in a different type of iissue, Execution test. All the field are copied in the new issue, includinge the Fix Verision.

:::danger
**Fix Verisions**
The field can reports multiple Fix Versions for Test, but only **one** Fix Versions has to be set for each Execution test. 
Make sure to have just one Fix Versions for each execution.
