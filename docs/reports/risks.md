The *Risk Report* is a document that summarizes the result of the risk analysis. It contains description of the potential risks a software user may face and the risk control measures (RCM) taken to mitigate the such risks. The *Risk Report* is one the documents that compose the *Risk Management File*, the is the collection of all documents produced during the risk management process. The other documents composing the *Risk Management File* are:
* *Risk Management Plan*: it defines the requirements for the review of the risk management activities, the risk acceptance criteria and the rationale behind that;
* *Risk Management Strategy*: it defines the procedures in the risk management defined for each project.

The *Risk Report* generated by Mia-Care P4SaMD is composed by data that comes are collected both from the issue tracking tool.

* **Release date**: the release date represents the date in which the related software has been released;
* **Risks**: the *Risk Report* contains the list of the risks of the related software version. Each risk is detailed with the following information:
  * **Risk code**: the unique identifier of the risk;
  * **Risk title**: the title of the risk;
  * **Risk status**: the status of the risk. In a release this should be always equal to *Accepted*, since there cannot be a release with unaccepted risks;
  * **Hazard**: the description of the hazard;
  * **Sequence of events**: the sequence of the events that may generate the risk;
  * **Hazardous situation**: the situation that can lead from the hazard;
  * **Harm**: the harm that can generate from the hazard;
  * **Probability**: the probability that the risky event will occur;
  * **Severity**: the severity of the consequence that the hazardous situation can generate;
  * **Risk Control Measure (RCM)**: the action taken to mitigate the risk;
  * **Mitigated Probability (mP)**: the probability that the risky event will occur after RCM implementation;
  * **Mitigated Severity (mS)**: the severity of the consequence that the hazardous situation can generate after RCM implementation;
  * **Residual Risk**: the residual risk after RCM implementation;
