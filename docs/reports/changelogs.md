## Report structure

Each generated Changelog is a markdown file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a microservice.
It makes easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the microservice.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
